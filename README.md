# Hi Robbie!

Let's get started.

## Prep
1) Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)
2) In Terminal, run `brew install python3`
3) Still in Terminal, run `pip3 install virtualenv`
(this step may not be required, but I think it is)
4) Download [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/education/?fromMenu#lang=python&role=learner)
   * PyCharm looks intimidating at first. Lots of buttons. Don't let it overwhelm you.

## Let's Go!
1) Now open PyCharm
2) Click "Learn" at the top, and Browse Courses
3) Learn!

Let me know how it's going, what you think, and I'll find more for you to learn.

Joe
