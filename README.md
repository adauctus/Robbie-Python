# Hi Robbie!

Let's get started.

## Prep
1) install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)
2) in Terminal, run `brew install python3`
3) Download [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/education/?fromMenu#lang=python&role=learner)
   * PyCharm looks intimidating at first. Lots of buttons. Don't let it overwhelm you.

## Let's Go!
1) Now open PyCharm
2) Click "Learn" at the top, and Browse Courses
3) Learn!

Let me know how it's going, what you think, and I'll find more for you to learn.

Joe
