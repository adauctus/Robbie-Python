# Hi Robbie!

Let's get started.

## Prep
1) install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)
2) in Terminal, run `brew install python3`
3) Download [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/education/?fromMenu#lang=python&role=learner)
   * PyCharm looks intimidating at first. Lots of buttons. Don't let it overwhelm you.

## Let's Go!
1) The Python ogranization has an okay list of tutorials: (here)[https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Programmers]
2) 
3) [Girls Do Django](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/python_introduction/)
is a wonderful way to get started with [django](https://www.djangoproject.com).
I found django to be slow to learn, so I think you may like to stick with (flask)[https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/]
